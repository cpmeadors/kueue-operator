                                admission controls how Kueue will process workloads.
                                admission is required.
                                Allowed values are Sequential, Parallel and "".
                                When admission is set to Sequential, only pods from the currently processing workload will be admitted.
                                Once all pods from the current workload are admitted, and ready, Kueue will process the next workload.
                                Sequential processing may slow down admission when the cluster has sufficient capacity for multiple workloads,
                                but provides a higher guarantee of workloads scheduling all pods together successfully.
                                When set to Parallel, pods from any workload will be admitted at any time.
                                This may lead to a deadlock where workloads are in contention for cluster capacity and
                                pods from another workload having successfully scheduled prevent pods from the current workload scheduling.
                                When set to "", this means no opinion and the operator is left

                            When set to ByWorkload, this means each workload is processed and considered

                            Where workloads do not become ready over time, the entire workload may then be evicted and retried at a later time.
                            None means gang scheduling is disabled.

                        preemption is the process of evicting one or more admitted Workloads to accommodate another Workload.
                        Kueue has classical premption and preemption via fair sharing.
                        preemption is optional.
                        If preemption is not specified, the operator will decide the default.

                            preemptionPolicy is an optional field.
                            The allowed values are Classical, FairSharing and "".
                            Classical means that an incoming workload, which does
                            not fit within the unusued quota, is eligible to issue preemptions
                            when the requests of the workload are below the
                            resource flavor's nominal quota or borrowWithinCohort is enabled
                            on the Cluster Queue.
                            FairSharing means that ClusterQueues with pending Workloads can preempt other Workloads
                            in their cohort until the preempting ClusterQueue
                            obtains an equal or weighted share of the borrowable resources.
                            The borrowable resources are the unused nominal quota
                            of all the ClusterQueues in the cohort.
                            FairSharing is a more heavy weight algorithm.
                            When set to "", this means no opinion and the operator is left
                            to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time.
                            The current default is Classical.

                        Workloads that are missing the queue-name will be ignored by Kueue.
                        If workloadManagement is not specified, the operator will decide the
                        default.
                        This default could change over time.

                            None means that workloads will be suspended on
                            creation and a label will be added via a mutating webhook.
                            This will be applied for all integrations that Kueue manages.
                            QueueName means that workloads that are managed
                            by Kueue must have a label kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name.
                            If this label is not present on the workload, then Kueue will
                            ignore this workload.
